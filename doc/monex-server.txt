Usage: monex-server configfile.json

CONFIGURATION FILE

The config file is a json file with two parts: targets and metrics. In the target
part you targets (at least one), monex-server will be able to fetch data from theme.
In the metric part, which is optional, you can sepcify custom metric for an easier
time when you have to query it, moreover, metric specify this way can be directly
pull with monex-draw.

The option of the config file are as follow:

targets:
    server: the name of the server, use when making a query
    type: Can be "promethes" or "influxdb"
    address: The address of the targer, with port (eg 127.0.0.1:9090)

metric:
    name: name of the metric

SERVER

All the interaction with the monex-server are made by sending json data to the
specific url with different HTTP Methode.

    POST /exp/<XPNAME>:
        Start the experiment

        Options:
            utc_time [OPTIONNAL]: start utc time of the experiment, unix timestamp.
            local_time [OPTIONNAL]: local time of the experiment, unix timestamp.

            Only one value of time can be sent (utc_time or local_time), if none is
            specify, the current time is used.

        Return:
            200 if success
            400 if the expriment alredy exist

    PUT /exp/<XPNAME>:
        End an experiment.

        Options:
            utc_time [OPTIONNAL]: utc time of the end of the experiment
            local_time [OPTIONNAL]: local time of the end of theexperiment

            Only one value of time can be sent (utc_time or local_time), if none is
            specify, the current time is used.

        Return:
            200 if sucess
            400 if the expriment alredy exist or is not started

    DELETE /exp/<XPNAME>:
        delete an experiment.

        Return:
            200 if success
            400 if the expriment not found

    GET /exp
        list all the experiments name and start/end time.

    GET /exp/<XPNAME>:
        Return a csv with experiment results

        Options:
            type [OPTIONNAL]: timestamp, duration (time since the start of 
                the experiment) or label (only for influxdb), default is timestanmp

            [for metric specify in the configuration file]
            metric: name of the metric

            [for a metric in prometheus]
            server: the name of the prometheus server (as in the configuration file)
            query: prometheus query (eg: rate(cpu_node[10s]))
            labels: The labels to use for naming the column, can be a single one
                (eg: "cpu") or an array (eg: ["cpu","mode"]). In the later case,
                the column will be name with all the labels separated by underscore.
            step [OPTIONNAL]: step of the value, default is 1s.

            [for a metric in influxdb]
            server: the name of the influxdb server name of the experiment
            measurement: Name of the measurement
            fields [OPTIONNAL]: An Array of the fields to take, default is all.
            database [OPTIONNAL]: Name of the databse, default is "monex"

            By default, the server name "default" is selected.
        Return:
            The csv representation of the data.


GRAFANA

    Grafana can be connected on Monex-server to show the name, start time and end
    time of the experiment. To do so you need to add Monex-server as a Data source
    using the simple-json-datasource.
    To have a variable listing all the experiment, you can add a variable (Templating) 
    querying for '*'.
    To see the start of your experiment, you have to add an annotations. For an 
    expriment called "myxp", you will use the query "start myxp".
    The same go for the end of an experiment with "stop myxp".
    You can combine the variable and annotation by querying "start $myvariable".

EXAMPLE:

Example of configuration file:

{"targets":[
  {"server":"prom", "type":"prometheus", "address":"127.0.0.1:9090"},
  {"server":"influx", "type":"influxdb", "address":"127.0.0.1:8086"}
],
"metrics":[
  {"name":"val","server":"influx", "measurement":"foobar"}
]}


To start an experiment:

  curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:5000/exp/myxp

To stop an experiment at a specify time:

  curl -X PUT 127.1:5000/exp/myxp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
    '{"utctime":"1512056178"}'

To get experiment results from a prometheus:

  curl -X GET 127.1:5000/exp/myxp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
    '{"query":"irate(cpu[4s])", "server":"prom", "labels":["cpu","mode"]}'

To get expriment results from influxdb:

    curl -X GET 127.1:5000/exp/myxp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
        '{"fields":["cgroup","io"],"server":"influx",\
        "measurement":"ebpf", "type":"sample"}'

To get experiment results from a value specify in the conf:

    curl -X GET 127.1:5000/exp/myxp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
      '{"metric":"val", "type":"duration"}'
